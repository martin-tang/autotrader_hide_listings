0.0.0.1
- added changelog, lots of changes at this point, impossible to track every little change although I would like to... Shows all the thought and effort I put in!
- Works when changing the page # 
- never calls findElements(), not sure why. Perhaps it's because getElementsByClassName is never null... Can you even call it with parameters? Or is that getElementByClassName() <- note the lack of plurality
- cute car favicon upgraded to be more visible
- changed popup window to "info.html" from "extension.html"
